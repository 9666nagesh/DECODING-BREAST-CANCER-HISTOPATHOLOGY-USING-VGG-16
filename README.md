This project leverages deep learning (VGG16) to classify breast cancer histopathology images into benign and malignant categories. The model is trained using transfer learning on a dataset of histopathological images, improving accuracy and efficiency in cancer diagnosis. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and a Flask-based web app for easy image classification.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Deep Learning Model (VGG16) â€“ Transfer learning approach for improved accuracy

âœ… Image Preprocessing â€“ Data cleaning, augmentation, and resizing

âœ… High Accuracy â€“ Achieves 96% validation accuracy

âœ… Confusion Matrix & Performance Metrics â€“ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

âœ… Flask Web App â€“ Upload images and get real-time predictions

âœ… User-Friendly Interface â€“ Simple UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
