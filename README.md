This project leverages deep learning (VGG16) to classify breast cancer histopathology images into benign and malignant categories. The model is trained using transfer learning on a dataset of histopathological images, improving accuracy and efficiency in cancer diagnosis. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and a Flask-based web app for easy image classification.
